reasonable absolute value.\n","- There was a smaller portion of extremely large positive values.\n","\n","I have identified 2 problems with the \"days_employed\" columns:\n","- Many of the values were negative and had a reasonable absolute value.\n","- There was a small portion of borrowers with 20.\n","\n","I have treated the problematic values as follows:\n","- I turned the nessecary negative values into positive by applying absolute value on the column.\n","- I replaced the incorrect extremely high values with the median of the correct employment days.\n","- I replaced the number of children \"20\" with \"2\".\n","\n","The reasons for using these methods are:\n","- I replaced the negative values with their absolute values since there was a very large portion of such values, so I couldn't delete them, since that would effect the statistics too much.\n","- I replaced the incorrect extremely high values with the median of the correct employment days, since it seems like the most simple and fast solution that wouldn't ruin the data analysis later. When there's a small portion of incorrect values, its influence on the statistics could be neglected and it can be changed. I used the median since the distribution of the values isn't symmetric and has some outliers, and if the distribution doesn't have outliers then it's still fine to use the median. In particular, the mean and the median of a symmetric distribution are equal.\n","- I have also considered converting the high values of employment days, assuming they appear in minutes or in hours by mistake, instead of in days, but doing so gave values that don't fit the shape of the overall distribution of days. \n","- I replaced the number of children \"20\" with \"2\" since this issue appeared in quite a few rows, and was the only very high value larger than 5, which makes it seem like a consistent typo, that could result from the fact that the \"0\" key is right under the \"2\" key on a keyboard.\n","\n","The possible reasons for such issues could be one or both of:\n","- A technical error, such as a mistake in the formula calculating the number of employment days for some of the borrowers - the difference between the day the borrower started working and today was calculated, instead of the opposite. Another option could be that some of the values were stored in a database where they were seperated by minuses between them, and then they automatically copying the values along with the minuses.\n","- A human error, such as when a bank worker or a borrower input the data incorrectly, but it is unlikely for the employment days, due to the huge amount of rows with negative values. Regarding the high positive values, these might occur due to not being consistent and inputing a time duration with a different meaning, such as number of hours instead of days.

identified 2 columns with actual missing values, \"days_employed\" and \"total_income\", both of which have \"float64\" type variables.\n","I have also identified a column with a missing value that was labeled - the \"gender\" column.\n","\n","The possible reasons that these missing values were present are:\n","- A simple reason for the missing values could be that the borrowers didn't know these values at the time of supplying the data, so they didn't fill them, planning to do so after verifying their values.\n","- The gender can be missing for a person with a non-binary gender.\n","- Both of the real variables can be missing if the corresponding borrowers are unemployed. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the same amounts of values are missing in both columns.

With even more inspection, we see that the missing values don't only appear for unemployed borrowers, so they shouldn't be simply replaced with zeros.\n","- Another reason could be a technical issue that prevented the saving of the values after they were input.\n","- Another less likely reason for the missing values could be that they weren't input when collecting the data, either by a bank employee or the borrower, because they overlooked them or forgot to do so, but again, this is more unlikely.\n","\n","I used the \"fillna\" method to fill in the real missing values with the median value of the corresponding columns, since the distribution of the values isn't symmetric and has some outliers, and if the distribution doesn't have outliers then it's still fine to use the median. In particular, the mean and the median of a symmetric distribution are equal.\n","I removed the row with the missing gender, since there's only one of those, so it's effect on the statistics is negligible."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"goxafxk5P4ky"},"source":["### Replacing data types"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"L1-NV0qkP4ky","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1624711249345,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Sergey Volkovich","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhLaHojh4qqBWHjJpX7ZhM37m9Jm_3xbsUqoPT3=s64","userId":"05527496459898703371"}},"outputId":"069001ce-e59e-4a1a-a42a-ac58d5851812"},"source":["# Replacing data types\n","print('Checking the data types by looking at the general information:')\n","print(data.info())\n","print()\n","print('Printing an example row:')\n","print(data.loc[0,:])\n","print()\n","\n","print('The following columns contain real variables but should contain integers: \"days_employed\" and \"total_income\".')\n","print()\n","data['days_employed'] = data['days_employed'].astype('int64')\n","data['total_income'] = data['total_income'].astype('int64')\n","\n","print('Verifying the data type changes by checking the general information:')\n","data.info()"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Checking the data types by looking at the general information:\n","<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 21524 entries, 0 to 21523\n","Data columns (total 12 columns):\n"," #

level can change the probability for defaulting on a loan by up to 2.54%.\n","- Borrowers with the lowest and with the highest incomes, namely with incomes of 0-10k, 40k-50k & 50k+, have relatively

more careful with taking them. Meanwhile, borrowers with high incomes don't need to take too many loans, and have more financial options for returning them. The borrowers with the medium incomes on the other hand, may simply take more loans to begin with, and it's not very easy for them to return them, so they end up with higher chances for defaulting.
